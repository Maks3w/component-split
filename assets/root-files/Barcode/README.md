# zend-barcode

`Zend\Barcode` provides a generic way to generate barcodes. The `Zend\Barcode`
component is divided into two subcomponents: barcode objects and renderers.
Objects allow you to create barcodes independently of the renderer. Renderer
allow you to draw barcodes based on the support required.
